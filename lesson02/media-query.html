            <h2>Alma 24:14</h2>
            <p>14 And the great God has had mercy on us, and made these things known unto us that we might not perish;
                yea, and he has made these things known unto us beforehand, because he loveth our souls as well as he
                loveth our children; therefore, in his mercy he doth visit us by his angels, that the plan of salvation
                might be made known unto us as well as unto future generations.

            <h2>2 Nephi 9:6</h2>
            <p>6 For as death hath passed upon all men, to fulfil the merciful plan of the great Creator, there must
                needs be a power of resurrection, and the resurrection must needs come unto man by reason of the fall;
                and the fall came by reason of transgression; and because man became fallen they were cut off from the
                presence of the Lord.</p>
